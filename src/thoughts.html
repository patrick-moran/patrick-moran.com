			<h2>Thoughts</h2>
			<p>Ideas I've reached through life, reading, and other people. </p>
			<p>Most of these bullets points are to remind myself what I've learned along the way.</p>
			<p>It's advice for myself, follow it if you dare.</p>
			<p>I don't like citing my sources.</p>

			<h2>Walking</h2>
			<p>I've been going for long walks lately.</p>
			<p>My body had been aching from lounging around too much.</p>
			<p>It's a case of if you don't use it, you lose it. I'm finding that more and more true as I get older.</p>
			<p>Walking is nice for not only your physical health, but mentally too.</p>
			<p>"Demons hate fresh air" is something that I think holds true.</p>
			<p>If you walk in the sun for a few hours, you can't help but feel rejuvenated.</p>
			<p>You were made to move, so do so.</p>

			<h2>Brotherhood</h2>
			<p>The only people that have ever hated me are females.</p>
			<p>I've yet to have a friendship with a guy that went entirely south and stayed that way.</p>
			<p>It's easy to create friendships with other men.</p>
			<p>There is no beating around the bush, we can bond over anything.</p>
			<p>The saying "All men are brothers" is timelessly true.</p>
			<p>It is a fraternal feeling that can't be explained other than it is primative in nature.</p>
			<p>It's us versus the world.</p>
			<p>Don't give up on the men in your community. We are strong when we are undivided.</p>

			<h2>Connections</h2>
			<p>It’s all about the people you know.</p>
			<p>Connections in life will offer you more than any skill or talent you have.</p>
			<p>If you know how to network with people and create and maintain friendships, you can succeed in any aspect of life.</p>
			<p>If I could go back and tell my younger self one thing, it would be to focus on meeting and creating relationships with people.</p>
			<p>Knowing people will lead you to opportunties and places that you can’t reach on your own.</p>

			<h2>Drinking</h2>
			<p>I’ll have a drink once in a while. I’m not opposed to casual drinking for any reason. I have other motives.</p>
			<p>Way back before I was even in high school, my mom told me this story of some guy whose parents offered to buy him a Rolex if he went through high school without drinking or doing any drugs. </p>
			<p>So I tried to do the same. I never drank until weeks after I graduated high school and still have never done drugs. I’m graduating college soon and still don’t have my gold watch.</p>
			<p>So, it isn’t some religious or moral reason I don’t drink, it just comes down to the fact that alcohol is disgusting.</p>
			<p>The worst by far is tequila – it smells toxic. Beer is up next. I could probably rant all day about how gross beer is – especially IPAs. Yeah, lemme pay $12 for this drink that tastes like pee and makes me as full as an In-N-Out 4x4. Even mixed drinks are too sugary to be something worth paying the exorbitant amount for – cocktails in the Bay Area are $16+ for a few ounces. Waste of money.</p>
			<p>I don’t really like hanging at bars either. You go into, and sometimes pay a cover charge for, this dark, loud room with tons of people you can’t trust so that you can catch up with friends? There’s gotta be a better place to do that.</p>
			<p>With all that, you should acknowledge that alcohol is essentially poison to the body. The worst nights/mornings in my life are directly related to the toll alcohol had on my body.</p>
			<p>I’m not interested in getting drinks. I think there’s other places we could go to sip on things that don’t taste and make me feel bad. Cheers.</p>

			<h2>Sunscreen</h2>
			<p>Use sunblock, not sunscreen.</p>
			<p>Most sunscreen you see at the store are shams.</p>
			<p>Anything that comes from a spray bottle is a waste of money. </p>
			<p>When buying sunscreen, if you see avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, homosalate, octisalate, or octinoxate on the label, don’t buy it.</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.pharmacist.com/article/sunscreen-chemicals-accumulate-body-high-levels">Those collections of chemicals</a> are harmful to your body and don’t protect you properly.</p>
			<p>Use sunscreen where Zinc oxide is the main ingredient on the bottle.</p>
			<p>It's usually called "mineral sunscreen".</p>
			<p>Zinc functions as <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-science-of-sunscreen">actual sunblock</a> and repels the sun’s rays from your skin. The unpronounceable chemicals above are sunscreen and actually absorb some of the light rays.</p>
			<p>Build up a tan so you don't have to wear much sunscreen.</p>

			<h2>Music</h2>
			<p>What you listen to severely affects your mood.</p>
			<p>Depressing music amplifies negative feelings.</p>
			<p>Upbeat music puts you in a positive mood.</p>
			<p>For that reason, I tend to only listen to uplifting music or instrumental music.</p>
			<p>With that, music doesn’t need to always be on.</p>
			<p>Do work and be in the moment without music if you can.</p>

		<div class="paragraph"> 
			<h2>Fitness</h2>
			<p>Your body is the only thing guaranteed in this life.</p>
			<p>It’s your vehicle, and if you don’t maintain and upgrade it, it will break down.</p>
			<p>Fitness is a combination of working out + nutrition.			</p>
			<p>Lift weights, play a sport, eat clean.</p>
			<p>There is no excuse not to get stronger.</p>
			<p>I don’t trust people if they can’t even take care of their own body.</p>


		</div>
		<div class="paragraph"> 
			<h2>Breathing</h2>
			<p>Imagine you have a small slit a centimeter wide along your Adam’s Apple.</p>
			<p>Now, try to breathe through that opening.</p>
			<p>Breathe in through the nose, out through the mouth.</p>
			<p>Lift weights, play a sport, eat clean.</p>
			<p>This allows you to good, deep breathes.</p>
			<p>Never mouth breathe.</p>

	<div class="paragraph"> 
		<h2>Phones</h2>
		<p>Your phone shouldn’t be the first or last thing you look at in a day. </p>
		<p>With that, don’t sleep with your phone in the same room.</p>
		<p>Remember why the phone was created: to communicate with other people.</p>
		<p>For that reason, don’t have it out when you are interacting with people in person. Don’t have it out on a date or at any meal with others.</p>
		<p>It is a tool not a toy. You do not need a new phone until yours no longer works.</p>
		<p>Minimize your device usage.</p>
		<p>Face time > screen time</p>

	<div class="paragraph"> 
		<h2>Inspiration</h2>
		<p>“Inspiration is perishable”</p>
		<p>If you feel inspiration to do something, act on it ASAP.</p>
		<p>You likely won’t be in the mood to work on it later on.</p>
		<p>Most good ideas die this way.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph"> 
		<h2>Reading</h2>
		<p>I used to try to read all books all the way through.</p>
		<p>I realized that most books are not worth reading in their entirety.</p>
		<p>Most books are full of filler and are dragged out to hit a page count.</p>
		<p>Just read whatever you are interested in the moment.</p>
		<p>Don't show off books you are reading or your bookshelf.</p>
		<p>The number of books you read means nothing.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph"> 
		<h2>Water</h2>
		<p>Start your day by chugging some water. At least half a liter.</p>
		<p>Swim in water as often as you can.</p>
		<p>Walk in the rain if you have the choice.</p>
		<p>Order sparkling water at the bar instead.</p>
		<p>Cold showers are for suckers. Hot water relaxes and recovers the body.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph"> 
		<h2>Clothes</h2>
		<p>Don't spend more than $30 on a t-shirt. They always get stained.</p>
		<p>Pants can't be bought online.</p>
		<p>Figure out your color pallete, then dress accordingly.</p>
		<p>Logos are for products. Avoid them if you can.</p>
		<p>Go barefoot if you can.</p>
