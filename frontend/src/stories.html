			<h2>Sleeping in a Treehouse</h2>

			<p>It was so high up that you’d have to snap your head as far back as it could go just to gaze up at the treehouse.</p>
			<p>I don’t remember we heard about it, it was probably from a post on social media. With rough directions, we went to find it. We marched through the afternoon with more gear than we could possibly need.</p>
			<p>The base of the tree was hidden past twenty minutes of steep trails.</p>
			<p>It looked impossible. There was no way we could climb something this tall – definitely not with our bags on. You had to squint to even seen the treehouse itself.</p>
			<p>I tried first. It was a strenuous climb on branches that were beginning to wear down. It felt like an eternity getting up there. Branch by branch, I hoisted myself up. At the top, a trapdoor was the final step before the safety and reassurance of the plywood platform.</p>
			<p>On it, there was a bench, coffee table, and other janky pieces. A swing swung right over the entire 80 foot drop. Every inch of the place was marked with doodles and quotes.</p>

			<p>I made use of a pulley and yanked our bags up.</p>
			<p>F took ages to climb and asked me to chat with him the whole time to distract himself from the unnerving height.</p>
			<p>We made a massive spread of food for dinner. The moon slipped through the few branches above us as we slept. In the morning, we had oatmeal.</p>
			<p>Only a few months later, police tore down the treehouse after some drunk kids fell from the thing.</p>
			<p>There’s lots of places like this in Santa Cruz. Abandoned or secret places where we can escape to. When we find them, we always make sure not to geotag them.</p>
			<p>A few remain hidden...</p>

			<h2>Filming Life on VHS</h2>
			<p>These videos were unlike anything I’d seen. They were capturing these epic nights in LA all on this retro VHS cam. They went by the name <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/search/lifewithuzi/photo">LifeWithUzi</a> and were posting on Tumblr and YouTube with these ancient camcorders.</p>
			<p>If these guys could get these old cameras to work, I wanted to give it a try.</p>
			<p>After scouring eBay, I found one that looked like it could work for about $30. I also ordered some VHS tapes that were brand new. As soon as it arrived, I started filming.</p>
			<img src="cam.jpg" alt="the camcorder">
			<p>I filmed parties, concerts, late-night adventures – anywhere that I could lug the camera around with my buddies, I took it.</p>
			<p>I was in an incentive to go out and do something. There is only so much you can film at your house.</p>
			<p>There is something about the look of VHS and other film media has this entrancing quality to it. The moments captured on it look authentic. Something that you just can’t easily replicate.</p>
			<img src="jett.jpg" alt="Deadmau4">
			<p>After compiling enough footage I went through and turned some of the better scenes into GIFs and <a href="https://patasonic.tumblr.com/">made a blog with them.</a></p>
			<p>In the last few weeks of high school, I edited the footage into a series for YouTube called, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGhKxSVxaWs&list=PL3m2JB98MMnyGETvH6enisu_uMoygsNkK">Ratsy Boys</a> – the nickname for our friend group. </p>
			<img src="grad.jpg" alt="Photo from graduation">
			<p>Since then, I’ve filmed tons more footage than I’ve put online. I’ve ran into countless problems turning those old, clunky tapes to digital. Broken cords, broken camcorders, faulty tapes.</p>
			<p>Maybe filming memories on 20+ year old tech isn’t the best idea.</p>

			<h2>Winning a 5K Race</h2>
			<p>As part of my fraternity’s philanthropy, we raised money for St. Jude Children's Hospital.</p>
			<p>Because of this, we decided to make an appearance at their annual 5K fundraiser.</p>
			<p>So we jammed down to the Bay and crashed at Jett and Brandon’s house in Daly City – close to the racecourse. </p>
			<p>The next morning, we’re at the SF Zoo. This year’s venue.</p>
			<img src="winner.jpg" alt="Got the gold">
			<p>I was positioned in the middle, in a flash, the race started and I took off. I side-stepped hordes of joggers before I found myself near the front pack. My start was speedy but I was surprised at my standing. The room between the frontrunners and myself thinned and I realized I actually had a good shot to place.</p>
			<p>We snaked through the zoo as incompetent volunteers worked to guide us the correct way. Next thing I know, the only person ahead of me is a guy with running shorts hiked up to an unflattering height – a college track or cross country athlete. He is so far ahead so I mentally settle for 2nd place.</p>
			<p>We are about a third of the way in and I see Short-Shorts take the wrong turn. Noting his mistake, I went into overdrive and bolted.</p>
			<p>I ran as hard as I could for the remainder of it. At the finish line, I collided with a wave of parents and strollers walking the course and slipped through them, securing the gold medal in front of the officials who weren’t anticipating runners being done yet.</p>
			<p>It was a race won through strategy with a slight amount of athleticism.</p>
			<p>I collected my plaque and went to check out the giraffes.</p>
			<img src="cheers.jpg" alt="Got the gold">

			<p>For years following this race, I still have received letters in the mail from St. Jude’s, almost weekly, begging for donations.</p>
